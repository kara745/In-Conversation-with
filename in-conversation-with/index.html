			<div class="container">
				<img src="images/Matt.jpeg" alt="Matt">
			<p>Matt&mdash;Honestly, I don’t have an inspiration in Graphic Design, however, if I were to chose two people they would be Dereck from Schedule 2. His vector work is amazing and his love for design is strong. The second person would be Ian McDonald. I would choose Ian because what he is teaching us in Web Design is fascinating and his style in building websites is what I want to absorb from his class.</p>
